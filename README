Fusandra - Cassandra FileSystem in UserspacE (FUSE) implementation

DESCRIPTION:

Fusandra is a proof of concept distributed filesystem, mountable anywhere and 
linked to an Apache Cassandra NoSQL database, therefore making it fault tolerant
 as well as extremely available.
Considering the usual properties filesystems offer and Cassandra's limitations, 
this is never intended to be an all purpose filsesystem, although it could have 
a few interesting use cases.


USAGE

To use Fusandra you'll need a running instance of Cassandra (0.8.x preferably)
with no authentication. Fusandra will automatically create all the structures it
needs whithin Cassandra on its first run

	chmod +x fusandra
	./fusandra directory_to_be_mounted


NOTES

This is still a VERY early version of Fusandra, it should be treated as highly 
unstable.


TODO

The rest of the implementation, Fusandra is still very incomplete and barely 
usable.
Any and all configuration options, including command line options to choose the 
Cassandra instance to use, authentication options, etc.
