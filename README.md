Fusandra - Cassandra Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) implementation

[![No Maintenance Intended](http://unmaintained.tech/badge.svg)](http://unmaintained.tech/)

DESCRIPTION:

Fusandra is a proof of concept distributed filesystem, mountable anywhere and 
linked to an Apache Cassandra NoSQL database, therefore making it fault tolerant
 as well as extremely available.
Considering the usual properties filesystems offer and Cassandra's limitations, 
this is never intended to be an all purpose filsesystem, although it could have 
a few interesting use cases.


USAGE

To use Fusandra you'll need a running instance of Cassandra with no authentication.
Fusandra will automatically create all the structures it needs whithin Cassandra
on its first run

	chmod +x fusandra
	./fusandra directory_to_be_mounted


NOTES

This is a usable, yet very experimental project. Proceed with caution.


TODO

Symlinks and other filesystem functionality that isn't basic file/dir manipulation.
Any and all configuration options, including command line options to choose the 
Cassandra instance to use, authentication options, etc.
